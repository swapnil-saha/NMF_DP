# Non-negative matrix factorization is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm for extracting meaningful features from inherently non-negative data. Such data often contain privacy-sensitive user information. Additionally, the dataset can contain outliers, which may lead to extracting sub-optimal features from the data. It is, therefore, necessary to address these two issues while analyzing privacy-sensitive data that may contain outliers. In this work, we develop a non-negative matrix factorization algorithm in the privacy-preserving framework that i) considers the presence of outliers in the data, and ii) can achieve results comparable to those of the non-private algorithm.
